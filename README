Apt Hack is a tool to help beginners make small changes to programs that come with the operating system, such as pidgin.  It is initially targeted at deb based systems such as Ubuntu.

Once changes have been made they can be shared as .hack files.  Several .hack files can be combined into a single .hacks file.

It will have a command-line tool (apt-hack) and a GUI.  Primary focus will be on the command-line tool.

Relevant Paths:

~/.config/apt-hack/config: Settings file
~/src/: Default location for forked packages
~/src/hacks/: Default location for hacks, in $package directory
~/src/debs/: Default location for compiled packages
~/src/originals/: Default location for storage of original .tar.gz and .dsc files

File Format:

.hack  A regular git-style patch file with additional information in the header:

 * the exact package name and version the patch was made against.  It may also contain ranges of known working versions.
 * the original author and his contact information
 * a description of the functionality the patch provides
 * names of binary files that should be added or removed (since patches aren't binary safe)

.hacks  A regular tar file containing multiple hacks.  It may contain an optional README file as well as a subdirectory call data/ which contains binary files referenced by the hack files.  It could also contain an example screenshot.

Open Issues:

 * Need to keep track of what the user has changed in order to generate the hack files.  quilt, perhaps?
 * Need a good example to demonstrate the usefulness of apt-hack.  It needs to be something that is a common annoyance, relatively easy to fix, and not likely to be fixed upstream.  Perhaps:
  * change keyboard shortcuts in liferea
  * change pidgin icon location in buddy list
 * .debhack and .debhacks might be more appropriate file extensions

Future Improvements:

 * Version control the patches for the user?  (The GUI user, for example, might want an undo.)
 * Create a central repository for hacks that is similar to github so that hacks can be improved, used as dependencies, etc.
 * Help the user attempt to apply regular .patch files as well.

GUI Ideas:

 * Launch an IDE for GUI users.  This might first require a hack to a particular project to make it IDE ready.
 * Search source code.
